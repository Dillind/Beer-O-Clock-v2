# Beer-O-Clock Project

This is the second version of the project as the first was more of a learning too l to see what I could demonstrate in ReactJS. After reviewing the code 
and receiving some feedback, I decided it was easier to just restart the project than to modify and restructure the entire code. 

## Description of Project:

It's Friday afternoon and you've had a long week and all you want to do is sit down, relax and drink a nice, cold beer. You walk up to the fridge, excited
at the prospect, but you open the door and find that all the beer is gone! You realise that you'll have to go down to the local bottle shop, but what to drink? You think for a moment, cycling through the few brands you like to drink, but get a sudden urge to change it up and try something new, but you don't know what to drink. Well, that's where Beer-O-Clock comes in, the one-stop beer app that allows you to select beers from a variety of countries, view their alcohol information and see if your local bottle shops stock them.
