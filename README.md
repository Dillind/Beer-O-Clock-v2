# Beer-O-Clock Project

This is the second version of the project as the first was more of a learning tool to see what I could demonstrate in ReactJS. After reviewing the code and receiving some feedback, I decided it was easier to just restart the project than to modify the code. 

## Description of Project:

The purpose of this project is to: 
(a) build a fun project that has a real-world use case. 
(b) to have a unique project for my portfolio
(c) demonstrates my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JS libraries (React) and APIs.
