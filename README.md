# Beer-O-Clock Project

This is version 2 of the project as the first just wasn't really cutting it. This version aims to be bigger and better in every way!

## Description of Project:

The purpose of this project was to (a) build something really fun, relevant and cool to me.. and (b) to have something to showcase to employers that I would be able to explain very clearly as it is something that I am passionate about. 

The only problem I keep running into is that I want to keep adding more and more features. However, I see this as an opportunity to continue adding more skills to my programming repertoire.
